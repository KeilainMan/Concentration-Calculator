# Concentration-Calculator
 
## Purpose 

This program shall provide an alternative environment for LC-MS concentration calculation. A commen way to access and calculate compound concentrations from LC-MS meassurements is through excel. Although excel provides a quick and accessable workflow, it sometimes is not as user friendly and one can quickly loose overview through a lack of visibility. 
This calculator shall provide visibility and security and personal confidence through standardization when calculating compound concentrations.

## Disclaimer

This calculator is in build-up phase and does not yet provide calculation capabilities!
